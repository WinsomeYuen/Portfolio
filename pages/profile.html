                <p class="profile-para">The human-centered design of interfaces; the use of code to
                    build innovative solutions; the logicality of it; the ability to translate ideas
                    and concepts for a user, are the many reasons why I have an interest in creating
                    products that exceed strategic objectives. I have explored a range of roles through
                    work experience and internships such as a web developer, web designer, creative producer,
                    and tech tutor. This has led me to picking up technical programming and design skills,
                    as well as research and analytical skills that have been transferable across all roles.
