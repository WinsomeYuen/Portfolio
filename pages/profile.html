                    I have explored various roles as a frontend developer, web designer, creative producer,
                    and tech tutor, however I define myself as a programmer with UI/UX skills. I enjoy
                    working collaboratively with developers and designers to formulate ideas for a product
                    with the thought of providing users with an enjoyable experience by understanding what
                    the <b> users needs </b> are, in addition to the rapid development of tech.
