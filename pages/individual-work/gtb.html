        <p><b>Who are Go Think Big?</b> This was what the project revolved around. Trying to tell the story of who Go Think Big
        are, to those who don't know about them. What made the project unique was a group of us behind the creation were young people
        making content for young people. The final video was finally finished after numberous refinements from feedback from Go Think Big
        and O2. Collaboratively with the client, audience, and support from Given we created as a team what Go Think Big is.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Final Video</h3>
        <p class="para">
            The final video was conceptualised by us the interns and we also directed it, whilst the editing was done by the agency through suggestions
            by us. Big Thankyou to all the past participants of Go Think Big opportunities who volunteered on the day and told their stories to us.
            (Also, you might see a small feature of me in it ðŸ˜„)

        <h3 class="title">Timeline</h3>
        <p class="para">
            We were set one month and 2 days a week to complete the project. With such a short time frame and so much
            work to do, therefore a timeline was created to clearly outline the goal for each day. This timeline was created
            by the awesome team at Given who provided us with resources (cameramen, room space, recording equipment) that helped
            make the magic happen! Each day consisted of a presentation by a member a Given on the module for the day that will
            help us in the research and design process later in the day. At the end of everyday we would present our findings and
            get feedback to help refine ideas.

        <h3 class="title">The Journey</h3>
        <p class="para">
            We first started the project with research like most projects. We split up int goups to rsearch on 2 main topics:
            <div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><h2 class="font2">Young People</h2></div><div class="col-sm-6">
                <h2 class="font1">Go Think Big</h2></div></div>

                    On the right is an article about the experience and motivation for applying for the internship. Overall it was an insightful experience that
                    was made great by the support from everyone in the tight-knit company. I enjoyed everyday that I went in and I learnt more than I ever
                    would of just from courses. Given had offered me an extended internship after we had finished the project, but unfortunately I had to go back
                    to university, but I would have definitely taken up the offer to work on more great projects with the companies core value of being sustainable.
