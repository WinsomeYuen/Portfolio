        <p><b>Who are Go Think Big?</b> This was what the project revolved around. Trying to tell the story of who Go Think Big
        are, to those who don't know about them. What made the project unique was a group of us behind the creation were young people
        making content for young people. The final video was finally finished after numberous refinements from feedback from Go Think Big
        and O2. Collaboratively with the client, audience, and support from Given we created as a team what Go Think Big is.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Final Video</h3>
        <p class="para">
            The final video was conceptualised by us the interns and we also directed it, whilst the editing was done by the agency through suggestions
            by us. Big Thankyou to all the past participants of Go Think Big opportunities who volunteered on the day and told their stories to us.
            (Also, you might see a small feature of me in it ðŸ˜„)

        <h3 class="title">Timeline</h3>
        <p class="para">
            We were set one month and 2 days a week to complete the project. With such a short time frame and so much
            work to do, therefore a timeline was created to clearly outline the goal for each day. This timeline was created
            by the awesome team at Given who provided us with resources (cameramen, room space, recording equipment) that helped
            make the magic happen! Each day consisted of a presentation by a member a Given on the module for the day that will
            help us in the research and design process later in the day. At the end of everyday we would present our findings and
            get feedback to help refine ideas.

        <h3 class="title">The Journey</h3>
        <p class="para">
        <h4 class="subtitle">Primary Research</h4>
            We first started the project with research like most projects. We split up int goups to rsearch on 2 main topics:
            <div class="row"><div class="col-sm-6"><h2 class="font2">Young People</h2></div><div class="col-sm-6">
                <h2 class="font1">Go Think Big</h2></div></div>
            These were the 2 main focus points on the project and we further split this topic down to be more specific with our research.
            In order to best utilise the time we did quick 5 minute research on each topic and then swapped to a different one. The short
            amount of time meant that each person would research on a single point for each topic and narrow down the research before feedback
            at the end of the speed-research.
        </p>

        <p class="para">
        <h4 class="subtitle">Interviews and Insights</h4>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTYWJeekNej3B2uyUBrScrzkpOvd_Bz2O9-p4aScqDJefm3LUGkaZw6Qaaj06fF2EXi4RyU4Gitxc48/pub?embedded=true"

                </div>
                <div class="col-sm-6">
                    Then we had to use our research to formulate questions for the depth-interviews. These were going to be with employees at O2 and GTB,
                    as well as past participants and the general public who either was a young person or used O2 as their mobile network. After we collated
                    the interview results we could develop insights to to structure and shortist the key concepts to incorporate in the video.

        </p>

        <p class="para">
        <h4 class="subtitle">Creative Planning</h4>
            Then came the fun stage where we got to be more creative. ðŸŽ‰ Using the insights we brainstormed ideas for the video and discussed each concept.
            Once we finally decided on an idea we created moodboards to come up with video ideas and propose them to Given. Then we could get deeper into
            the creation of the video by creating storyboards as a group. A manifesto was created to propose the idea to Go Think Big and O2. Finally anchor
            words and tone of voice for the video was discussed with the senior creative at Given. Below is a presentation of the whole creative process.

                    On the right is an article about the experience and motivation for applying for the internship. Overall it was an insightful experience that
                    was made great by the support from everyone in the tight-knit company. I enjoyed everyday that I went in and I learnt more than I ever
                    would of just from courses. Given had offered me an extended internship after we had finished the project, but unfortunately I had to go back
                    to university, but I would have definitely taken up the offer to work on more great projects with the companies core value of being sustainable.
