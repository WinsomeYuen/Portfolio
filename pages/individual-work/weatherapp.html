    This project was for my module called Graphical User Interfaces. The aim of the group project was to develop
    a weather application for a specific use. After brain storming some ideas and doing research on weather apps,
    we decided to make a weather app for people who do outdoor water sports. The project required deep research on
    the stakeholders for the app, so that we could then develop designs. We developed a prototype a rapid prototype
    as a team to present to the markers and afterwards we did a heuristic evaluation.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-*">
          <h4 class="subtitle">Primary Stakeholder</h4>
          <p class="para">People who participate in water sport is our primary stakeholder because
            there has been a huge increase on people taking up a water sport activity and weather is a
            key factor. Research into the background demographic for boating and water sports, showed
            that there was an increase of 2 million more participants in 2016 and over 14.3 million people
            partaking in any water sport activity. With a 10% increase of participation in non-seasonal
            times of year when the weather is more temperamental, the weather plays an important role for
            people partaking in water sport activities. <p>
          <h4 class="subtitle">Data Gathering</h4>
          <p class="para">We decided to collect data using a Questionnaire via Google Form (example on the right);
            it is an online platform, making it faster to process. We can obtain data from a large sample pool as
            it can be distributed easily to a wide range of people from various locations. The majority of the questions
            are closed to make it quick for people to fill out and this means that data analysis can be more effectively
            carried out on the answers.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Results</h4>
    <p>To find survey participants, we posted the survey on social media groups dedicated to water sports as well
      as the general public. The survey was also advertised in the Queen Mary student union to target water sports
      teams and clubs. This meant we got a wide range of responses.</p>
    <br/>

    <br/>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Wireframes</h4>
    <p class="para">The choice between phone and tablet was simple for this application for numerous reasons that were supported
      by our stakeholder research: it is much more convenient to bring a phone to a beach than it is to bring a tablet, since
      many modern smartphones are waterproof and only few tablets are. Phones are pocket sized and so easier to transport, especially
      when the user is also carrying sports equipment between sites.
    </p>
    <div class="row text-center">
      <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h5 class="caption">Landing Page</h5>
        <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1895/30628642228_dbaaa2cec7_o.png">
        <p class="para">
          Our focus was on legibility and speed of use, so rather than having a login or preferences screen
          as many competitors do, we decided the application should open to a simple screen with the minimum
          amount of text so that users can quickly view their options.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-4">

        <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1888/43780644284_5ec7cc1853_o.png">
        <p class="para">There are more options available for users who need more specific information, including three ways
          to specify a location: by entering a postcode, by selecting from a drop down list of nearby beaches and
          bodies of water, or by using their phones location services. </p>
      </div>

        <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1900/44498539811_a629866d94_o.png">
        <p class="para"> The decision to limit the number of widgets displayed was informed by our research, which suggested
          that our users prefer not to sacrifice ease of use for detail, and in most cases only need 3-5 pieces of information. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The weather app was to be used by people who partake in watersports. The user would type in a location
      (country, city, postcode) which would then be used by the geolocation api to get the co-ordinates, that would
      then query the weather api to get a json file with weather information that can be displayed about the location.</p>
    <br/>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Roadmap</h4>
    <p class="para">Below we have created a Gantt Chart to plan and track specific tasks in the project. We have broken down the development
      phase into three main tasks to be completed. The way we have ordered these tasks is of importance. The two tasks that are
      developed simultaneously is of highest priority whilst, the third task is important, but if not fully finished the application
      will still be fully functioning and somewhat meet most the user requirements on our list.</p>

  <h3 class="title">Evaluation</h3>
  <p class="para">
    There were five evaluators for the application and they were each given a checklist with quick and brief questions that
    cover the ten Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. The majority of the questions were for a specific element
    so that the answers are concise. This checklist was done for each component of the application (there are two in total)
    so that the evaluators can concentrate on each one and answers would be specific to the component being looked at. In
    order to fully test the application, we divided the evaluators into two groups (mobile/desktop) so that we could see if
    there are patterns when using each specific platform as well as comparing  the two different user experiences.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
    Consistency with the user interface was tested by seeing if users can distinguish between buttons, input fields and text
    presented by the application. The users were also asked to input incorrect data to see what steps they would take if an
    error occurred. Users were asked to identify the information displayed to test if it was relevant and whether the results
    were as they expected of a weather application for users who participate in watersports; in addition the users were asked
    to identify how useful the information was.
  </p>
  <h4 class="subtitle">Proposed Improvements</h4>
  <p class="para">
    <b>Error Prevention</b> - this was a big problem that was found in the evaluation. In order to fix this:
    <div class="row text-center">
      <div class="col-sm-6">
          <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1845/42835445520_e7cc4e2cf7.jpg">
          <p class="para">
            The input box for searching a location should state the type of values that users can enter by displaying a pop-up as
            the user types into the box so that it instantly catches the users attention. Afterwards, a function should check the
            input against a list of requirements before being sent to the next component of the application to reduce the time
            trying to process an incorrect input. If input is correct, a green tick should be displayed next to the input box to indicate this.
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
          <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1878/43926431194_40ed3e3285.jpg">
          <p class="para">
            The APIs should catch errors when locations cannot be found and display an alternative result depending on the type of
            error, for example the location has no data found, so users can understand what the error was and retry. The error display
            will be at the center of the screen and will be the only element.
          </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <b class="para">Efficiency of use/User control</b> - timing for displaying results were relatively fast, however, for the design:
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-*">
        <p class="para">
          A back button to return to the search page after the results for the users initial search has been displayed on
          the screen should be implemented. The button would be at the bottom of the search result, allowing the user to have
          a read through the information displayed. They could go back without using the phones back button, and this will have
          a lower chance of crashing the application.
