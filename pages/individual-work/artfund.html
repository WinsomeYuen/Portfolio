        <p>This was the first art competition I have ever entered.</p>

                <p>These are the final design entries I chose to enter into the competition. The idea behind my design
                was to incorporate the different things Art Fund offers when you buy their card. The design used vector
                graphics to keep it simple. The message I wanted to send across was the amount of things you could do with
                the card for only Â£5.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Improvements for the future</h2>
        <p>This art competition piece really inspired me to go into design as it had been a long time since I got excited
        about working on a project not for university or work. There were a lot of things I learnt from thsi experience too:
            <div class="card card-role">
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Concentrate on a specific idea.</b> I had tried to include so many different ideas into one piece that it got
                    a bit cluttered and made it difficult for an audience to grab the idea of what the posters ar presenting</li>
                    <li><b>The main text I want to highlight should be more centered.</b> I had placed the price and the card itself right
                    at the bottom, which can be easily missed by somebody looking at the poster.</li>
                    <li><b>Research more on the interests of the target audience.</b> Although I felt the design stood out cause of the style
                        and colours used, it would be mistaken to be aimed at children because of the imagery used.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2 class="title">Other Designs I had created</h2>
            <p>These were the other designs I had created before the final design above. Looking back on them now and reflecting
                on what the competition brief was, I think some of these designs would of worked better as an entry. So note to self
                for the future is that less is more! I don't need to do some fancy intricate design to get the attention of the audience.
                I just need something easy to see in a crowd and communicates the message directly.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Video Advert</h2>
        <p>Besides creating the posters, I decided to create a video campaign too using the vector graphics I created. The idea
        for the video was similar to the posters. I tried to show as many things Art Fund offers in 30 seconds.</p>
