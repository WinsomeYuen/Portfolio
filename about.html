            <p class="card-text mb-auto">The design of programs; the use of code; the logicality of it; the ability to customise programs for a person, are the many reasons why I have an interest in creating products that exceed strategic objectives.
              In the summer I learnt about 3D game design in Unreal Engine and 3D modelling using Blender to teach children at my summer job as a tech tutor, this got me interested in both programming and design. Whilst, for the Code for Good hackathon,
              I worked in a team of 6 to create a web application for the charity Equal Measure 2030.
              My role was UX Designer/Front-end Developer which consisted of:
              <ul><li>In charge of creating the wire frame's and designing the art boards on Affinity Designer to suit the project requirements, whilst consulting with the client to ensure it met their needs</li>
                <li>Created basic graphics for the web application in collaboration with the front end developers</li>
                <li>Assisted with some front end development using HTML&CSS and AngularJS</li></ul>
